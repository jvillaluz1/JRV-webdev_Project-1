  <h1>My Project Wingman Review (or Analysis)</h1>

  <h2>What is Project Wingman?</h2>
  <p>
    To put it simply, Project Wingman is an indie arcade flight game. I would describe it as a love letter to 
    the Ace Combat franchise, as it shares similar gameplay elements.
  </p>
  <p>
    The game features two campaigns: the base campaign and a DLC called Frontline-59, which was 
    exclusive to PlayStation 5. Additionally, there is a mode called Conquest, a wave-based survival mode 
    where missions progressively increase in difficulty.
  </p>

    <h2>The Base Campaign</h2>
    <img src="images/pwkeyart.png" alt="Project Wingman Key Art">
    
    <div>
      <h3>For the sake of time, I will not go into deep detail about the plot, as both the base campaign and 
      Frontline-59 have complex narratives.</h3>
    </div>

    <p>
      In the base campaign, you play as a mercenary pilot in the Sicario Mercenary Corps, specifically as 
      part of the Hitman Squadron. Your callsign? Monarch.
    </p>
    <p>
      The story takes place centuries after a catastrophic tectonic event known as "The Calamity," 
      which triggered massive destruction across the Pacific Ring of Fire. Fast forward about 400 years, 
      new global powers have emerged, and the world has changed drastically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among these powers is the Pacific Federation, a coalition of former governments, corporations, 
      and military institutions that control vast territories and resources. At the beginning of the game, 
      you and your squadron finish a contract in the Caribbean, destroying a Federation cargo 
      containing a volatile element called Cordium, an energy-rich geothermal resource over which 
      the Federation holds a monopoly.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this mission, you and the Sicario Mercenary Corps get involved in the Cascadian Civil War 
      for profit. According to Stardust, a Cascadian National Guard pilot, Cascadia was once an 
      associate of the Federation but sought independence over fears of "federalization" and the 
      relentless exploitation of its Cordium reserves to fuel the Federation’s war machine.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the conflict escalates, you begin to witness the war's true devastation, including the complete 
      destruction of the Cascadian city of Prospero by Cordium cruise missiles. This event sets off a 
      second catastrophe, causing the situation to spiral out of control.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>Frontline-59</h2>
    <img src="images/pwfrontline59.jpg" alt="Project Wingman Frontline-59 Key Art">

    <p>
      At some point during the Cascadian Civil War, the Cascadian forces and their mercenary allies 
      gain the upper hand after a decisive victory over the Pacific Federation at the Bering Strait. 
      The Federation's forces are nearly wiped out—by the time Frontline-59's first mission begins, 
      only a dozen active Federation fighter squadrons remain.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the Federation on the brink of collapse, Crystal Kingdom (Federation High Command) 
      issues an emergency recall, deploying reserve squadrons to reinforce the war effort. 
      However, their intervention comes too late. Many of the Federation’s elite Peacekeeper 
      Squadrons are forced to retreat, leaving you, K-9A "Driver," and the rest of the K-9 Reserve 
      Division to fight against overwhelming odds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately, Driver’s exceptional piloting skills allow your squadron to secure a fighting chance, 
      covering the retreat of the remaining Federation forces. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Unlike the base campaign, where you fight for Cascadia and the mercenaries, 
      Frontline-59 puts you in the cockpit of a Federation pilot, tasked with defending key Cordium 
      geothermal facilities from Cascadian and mercenary attacks. If these facilities fall, the Federation 
      faces an inevitable collapse.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>Conquest</h2>
    <img src="images/pwconquest.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the Project Wingman Conquest mode">
    
    <p>
      Conquest mode is a more freeform experience, allowing you to lead a squadron in a series of 
      progressively difficult missions.
    </p>
    <p>
      There isn’t a defined story for this mode, leaving players to create their own headcanons or fan 
      fiction based on the game's lore. The gameplay revolves around completing missions, earning 
      points, and unlocking new aircraft and even airships to aid you in your conquests.
    </p>

  <div>
    <h2>The Gameplay of Project Wingman</h2>
    
    <p>
      If you’re familiar with the Ace Combat series, you’ll feel right at home. The game features a wide 
      array of weaponry, including standard STMD Fox-2s (infrared missiles), MLAAs (multi-lock anti-air 
      missiles), UGBLs (unguided bombs), and MLAGs (multi-lock anti-ground missiles). With so many 
      different missile types, you’ll find a playstyle that suits you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unlike hardcore flight simulators, your primary concerns aren’t fuel management or navigation—
      it’s the relentless barrage of enemy missiles and dogfights. Dodging these while taking out 
      priority targets is the key to survival. Oh, and try not to crash into large planes or airships.
    </p>
    
    <img src="images/pwvr.jpg" alt="A screenshot of Project Wingman in VR">
    
    <p>
      The game is visually stunning. Ignore the low-resolution ground textures, and you’ll see that every 
      frame looks like a painting. Project Wingman even supports VR, which, while overwhelming, 
      provides an incredibly immersive experience.
    </p>
